# Phases — Trade Map Automated Export System

Each phase touches ≤8 files and produces exactly one demoable thing.
These are BUILD phases. They map onto the PRD's test milestones (PRD §51) but are
sized for incremental delivery. Do phases in order; do not start N+1 until N demos.

Legend: **Demo** = the one observable thing that proves the phase is done.

## Status
| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| 1 — Single-country PoC (Dominica) | ✅ DONE — verified live 2026-08-17 |
| 2 — Config engine + resolver + filename | ✅ DONE — headless AC green 2026-08-17 (live Dominica re-run recommended) |
| 3 — Range isolation (India→Pakistan→China) | ✅ DONE — headless 29/29 + live 3-file run, truthful effective range 2026-08-17 |
| 4 — Batch loop + retry + failure evidence | 🟦 4A DONE — headless 22/22 + build clean 2026-08-17 · 4B (live `--batch` run) carried |
| 5 — Manifest + resume + idempotency + collision | 🟦 5A DONE — headless 24/24 + build clean 2026-08-17 · 5B (live kill/resume) carried |
| 6 — Session-expiry + query gate + report | ⬜ todo |
| 7 — 30-country production + acceptance | ⬜ todo |

## Now
**Country-code harvester is LIVE-PROVEN and hands-off.** `npm run harvest` seeds a data page, clicks the
Importer picker open, types each country, and confirms its code via the page heading — no manual clicking,
no invented codes (the picker is a custom `<app-country-picker>` on a CDK overlay, NOT `<mat-option>`).
10 real countries confirmed (USA/Germany/UK/Hong Kong China/France/Japan added this session); **194 of 204
still to harvest.** All Phases 2–5 + the harvester fix are now committed on `phase-1-poc`; build is clean.
**#1 priority next: run the full harvest, reconcile any spelling mismatches, then the first real 200+ export.**
Biggest risk to a hands-off full run: session expiry mid-export (Phase 6 auto re-login not built).

## Next 3
1. **Harvest all remaining codes** — `npm run harvest` (all ~194; one login, leave running). Reconcile any `✗`
   names via `logs/calibration/picker-open-*.html`, rerun harvest to finish them, then the first real
   `npm run export -- --batch --countries input/countries-full.xlsx`.
2. Phase 6 — session-expiry pause/resume (the key enabler for an unattended full export) + query-validation
   gate polish + `run-report.xlsx` (§28/§31).
3. Phase 5B / 4B (live, carried) — kill-and-resume demo + one live `--batch` incl. a bogus name; fold into Phase 7.

## Carried into Phase 3 (from Phase 2)
- One live `npm run export -- --country Dominica` to confirm the refactor didn't regress
  the real download (needs manual login; all headless AC already pass).
- The resolver's UI-search selectors are structured but UNCALIBRATED — pin them against the
  live DOM when adding India/Pakistan/China.

## Phase 1 — Single-country proof of concept (Dominica)  ✅ DONE (2026-08-17)
Scaffold the project, log in once (manual, persistent session), build the canonical
query for ONE country, detect its effective range, click Save, capture the XLSX,
save+rename to the configured folder, and validate the file.
Full locked spec: `docs/spec/phase-1-single-country.md`
**Demo:** one valid `Dominica_TradeMap_...xlsx` in `./output`, passing all 5 file checks.
Files: package.json, tsconfig.json, config/config.json, config/country-codes.json,
src/index.ts, src/trademap/driver.ts, src/auth/session.ts, src/files/save-validate.ts

## Phase 2 — Config engine + country-code resolver + filename generator  ✅ DONE (2026-08-17)
Externalize all filters/dates/paths; ISO-numeric country-code map with UI-search
fallback; configurable filename template rendered from effective range.
Full locked spec: `docs/spec/phase-2-config-resolver-filename.md`
**Demo:** change `config.json` (dates or filename template) → output filename/range
changes with zero code edits. Unknown country → resolver logs "UI resolution used".
Files: src/config/loadConfig.ts, src/config/schema.ts, src/country/resolver.ts,
src/files/filename.ts, config/config.json, config/country-codes.json

## Phase 3 — Range isolation across 3 countries (India → Pakistan → China)  ← NEXT
Reset filters + global range after EVERY country switch; prove Pakistan's clipped
start (202401) does not bleed into China. This is the most important functional test.
**Demo (AC-01):** 3 files — China `200001-202606`, Pakistan `202401-202606`,
India `200001-202606`; each header verified before Save.
Files: src/orchestrator/runCountry.ts, src/trademap/filters.ts,
src/trademap/rangeEngine.ts, src/trademap/verifyQuery.ts

## Phase 4 — Batch loop + countries.xlsx reader + per-country retry + failure evidence
Read ordered country list from Excel; loop sequentially; retry each country up to 3×;
on failure capture screenshot + URL + filters + timestamp and continue the batch.
**Demo:** 5-country batch; one deliberately-failing country still yields a screenshot
+ error log and the remaining countries complete.
Files: src/input/readCountries.ts, src/orchestrator/runBatch.ts,
src/orchestrator/retry.ts, src/evidence/captureFailure.ts, input/countries.xlsx

## Phase 5 — Run manifest + resume + idempotency + collision modes
Write a run manifest as countries complete; on restart, resume only PENDING countries;
skip already-SUCCESS+validated files unless `--force`; skip/overwrite/version collisions.
**Demo (AC-07):** kill the run after country 2 of 5; rerun starts at country 3.
Files: src/manifest/manifest.ts, src/manifest/resume.ts, src/files/collision.ts,
src/orchestrator/runBatch.ts

## Phase 6 — Session-expiry pause/resume + query-validation gate + run report
Detect login redirect → PAUSE the whole run (not fail-3×), let user re-login, resume
current country. Hard gate: never Save unless every filter+heading matches. Emit
human-readable `run-report.xlsx`.
**Demo (AC-08):** expire the session mid-run → automation pauses and prompts login,
then resumes; `run-report.xlsx` lists requested/effective/status/attempts per country.
Files: src/auth/expiry.ts, src/orchestrator/runBatch.ts, src/report/runReport.ts,
src/trademap/verifyQuery.ts

## Phase 7 — 30-country production hardening + full acceptance
Large-download timeouts, structured logging polish, and an end-to-end run validating
every acceptance criterion AC-01…AC-12.
**Demo:** full 30-country batch completes with manifest + run-report; AC checklist green.
Files: src/logging/logger.ts, config/config.json, docs/spec/acceptance.md,
src/orchestrator/runBatch.ts
